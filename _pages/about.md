Hi! My name is Michael, I'm a Ph.D candidate in astronomy with [The Institute for Exoplanet Research (iREx)](http://www.exoplanetes.umontreal.ca/?lang=en) at the [Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca).

Who hasn't looked up at the sky on a clear night and wondered whether or not we are alone in the universe? Like I was, you may be surprised to learn that this question is no longer solely confined to the realm of science fiction! Thanks to missions like [Kepler](kepler mission discoveries), astronomers have discovered over 4000 planets orbiting around stars other than our Sun. We now know there is a veritable zoo of exoplanets in our galaxy, many of which look very different from the eight planets in our solar system. But not only can we infer the physical properties of exoplanets, but using spectroscopic techniques, we can also probe the compositions of their atmospheres.

This is an extremely exciting time for exoplanetary science. Using high-resolution spectroscopic techniques, instruments like SPIRou are beginning to put constraints on the abundances of CO and CH$_4$ in the atmospheres of exoplanets. This is a major step towards obtaining accurate atmospheric C/O ratios - which is predicted to be an important tracer of a planet's formation and migration history. Furthermore, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), set to launch in October 2021, will extend the realm of exoplanets amenable to atmosphere characterization down to Earth-analogs, potentially allowing us to identify so called 'Earth-clones' - exoplanets with the same size, and atmospheric composition as the Earth.

Along with my advisor, [David Lafrenière](http://www.exoplanetes.umontreal.ca/our-team/professors/david-lafreniere-2/?lang=en), my research focuses on using these next-generation instruments to determine the composition of exoplanet atmospheres. I am a part of the [NEAT](http://www.stsci.edu/jwst/observing-programs/program-information?id=1201) (NIRISS Exploration of the Diversity of Transiting Exoplanets) observing program, which will use the JWST's NIRISS (Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrometer) instrument to observe planets as diverse as the Earth-analog TRAPPIST-1f, to the super-Jupiter sized WASP-127b.  

Prior to arriving in Montréal, I completed an M.Sc. in astrophysics at [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca). Working with Dr. Doug Welch, I developed a method to search for faint light-echoes from supernovae in the spectacular ‘Fireworks Galaxy’. You can read my open-access dissertation [here]( https://oatd.org/oatd/record?record=handle%5C:11375%5C%2F24780). I also completed my B.Sc. at McMaster, where for my honour’s thesis with Dr. Laura Parker, I studied the dark matter haloes of galaxy clusters in the Bolshoi Cosmological Simulation.   

I am very passionate about astronomy outreach. I was a presenter for numerous years at the [McCallion Planetarium](https://www.physics.mcmaster.ca/planetarium/), as well as a part of McMaster's [Sidewalk Astronomy](https://www.physics.mcmaster.ca/sidewalkastronomy/) program. Here in Montréal I am a part of the [Montréal Student Space Association](https://www.facebook.com/montrealspace/), as well as a regular contributor to the Astronomy on Tap events. I also regularly attend inter-university conferences and workshops, and have given award-winning talks at national conferences. Science communication has always been a big part of my life, et habitant maintenant à Montréal, je cherche toujours à améliorer ma communication scientifique en français !
