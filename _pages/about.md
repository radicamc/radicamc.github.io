Hi! My name is Michael, I'm a Ph.D candidate in astronomy with [The Trottier Institute for Research on Exoplanets (iREx)](http://www.exoplanetes.umontreal.ca/?lang=en) at the [Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca).

Who hasn't looked up at the sky on a clear night and wondered whether or not we are alone in the universe? Like I was, you may be surprised to learn that this question is no longer solely confined to the realm of science fiction! Thanks to missions like Kepler and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), astronomers have discovered over 5000 planets orbiting around stars other than our Sun. We now know there is a veritable zoo of exoplanets in our galaxy, many of which look very different from the eight planets in our solar system. But not only can we infer the physical properties of exoplanets, but using spectroscopic techniques, we can also probe the compositions of their atmospheres.

I am particularly interested in the atmospheres of planets which seem to be "outliers" in the broader exoplanet population. A great example are so-called hot-Neptunes: a class of planets with masses similar to Neptune, but that orbit far closer to their host star than Mercury does to the Sun. Planet formation theories tell us that no Neptune-sized planets should be able to survive in such an inhospitable environment -- high energy radiation from the host star should completely evaporate their atmospheres. However, we have recently found several hot-Neptunes! There incredible discoveries beg the question of how these unlikely planets have managed to survive despite all odds: did they form very recently and are in the process being evaporated, are they older but have recently migrated to their current orbital configuration, or do they possess some unique atmospheric properties which allows them to survive so close to their host star? Via observations with state-of-the-art observatories like the Hubble Space Telescope and JWST, these are some of the questions I'm looking to answer.

Prior to arriving in Montréal, I completed an M.Sc. in astrophysics at [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca). Working with Dr. Doug Welch, I developed a method to search for faint light-echoes from supernovae in the spectacular ‘Fireworks Galaxy’. You can read my open-access dissertation [here]( https://oatd.org/oatd/record?record=handle%5C:11375%5C%2F24780). I also completed my B.Sc. at McMaster, where for my honour’s thesis with Dr. Laura Parker, I studied the dark matter haloes of galaxy clusters in the Bolshoi Cosmological Simulation.
