Hi! My name is Michael, I'm a Ph.D student in astronomy with [The Institute for Exoplanet Research (iREx)](http://www.exoplanetes.umontreal.ca/?lang=en) at the [Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca).

Along with my advisor, [David Lafrenière](http://www.exoplanetes.umontreal.ca/our-team/professors/david-lafreniere-2/?lang=en), my research focuses on using next-generation instrumentation to study the atmospheres of exoplanets. This is an extremely exciting time for exoplanetary science. Not only have missions like [Kepler](kepler mission discoveries), and [TESS](https://tess.mit.edu) discovered thousands of new planets, but insights from Spitzer, and Hubble have begun to provide clues into the molecules present in the atmospheres of these distant worlds.

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with its wider bandwidth and increased sensitivity, will take the study of exoplanet atmospheres to the next level. I am a part of the [NEAT](http://www.stsci.edu/jwst/observing-programs/program-information?id=1201) (NIRISS Exploration of the Diversity of Transiting Exoplanets) observing program, which will use the JWST's NIRISS (Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrometer) instrument to observe planets as diverse as the Earth-analog TRAPPIST-1f, to the super-Jupiter sized WASP-127b.  

Prior to arriving in Montréal, I completed an M.Sc. in astrophysics at [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca). Working with Dr. Doug Welch, I developed a method to search for faint light-echoes from supernovae in the spectacular ‘Fireworks Galaxy’. You can read my open-access dissertation [here]( https://oatd.org/oatd/record?record=handle%5C:11375%5C%2F24780). I also completed my B.Sc. at McMaster, where for my honour’s thesis with Dr. Laura Parker, I studied the dark matter haloes of galaxy clusters in the Bolshoi Cosmological Simulation.   

I am very passionate about astronomy outreach. I was a presenter for numerous years at the [McCallion Planetarium](https://www.physics.mcmaster.ca/planetarium/), as well as a part of McMaster's [Sidewalk Astronomy](https://www.physics.mcmaster.ca/sidewalkastronomy/) program. Here in Montréal I am a regular contributor to the Astronomy on Tap events. I also regularly attend inter-university conferences and workshops, and have given award-winning talks at departmental and national conferences. Science communication has always been a big part of my life, et habitant maintenant à Montréal, je cherche toujours à améliorer ma communication scientifique en français !
