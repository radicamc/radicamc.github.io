Hi! I'm Michael, an NSERC postdoctoral fellow at the University of Chicago.

I'm interested in better understanding the diverse nature of exoplanets in the galaxy. I'm primarily an observer, who studies the atmospheres (or lack thereof) of exoplanets with space telescopes like JWST and HST, though I also dabble in radial velocities and other ground-based observations. I'm interested in all sorts of planets, from ultra-hot-Jupiters, to rocky Earth-twins -- so if you have a planet, it'll probably interest me!

I also write whimsically named software packages to analyze exoplanet observations. You can find most of them on [GitHub](https://github.com/radicamc).

You can reach me via email at: radicamc (at) uchicago.edu
